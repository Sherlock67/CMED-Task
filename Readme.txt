Hi,
Myself Mushfiqul Alam
I was assigned to make this website which is named as Prescription Generator.
First of all i want to surrender my lackings and what things i could not apply here.
I could not apply the Date wise count of presecription and also in AddPrescription i could not post the date properly.
Now i want to share what i have used to make this application.
For Design Pattern,I have used Repository Pattern.
For Architecture , I have used N-tier Architecture 
I have also used Dependency Injection.
You will find four project under one solution.
CMED_API containing all the API
CMED_BusinessLayer is we have all the services to communicate with Database.
CMED_DataAcessLayer we all have the repository and interfaces.
CMED_WEB we have all the views 

N.B 
At the bottom of the question there was a api link 
i have feteched it 
You will find it in AllPrescription View 
A button named All Services will take you to that table page.
I have not showed all the data because of its size.
Hope its considerable.
Best Regards
Mushfiqul Alam
